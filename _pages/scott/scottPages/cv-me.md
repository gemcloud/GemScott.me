### A bit about me

Hi, I'm Thomas. I'm 30 years old, living in Ghent. I'm a professional Frontend Developer, currently working at The Reference.

What I like most about Frontend development is the ever-changing technology. New frameworks being released daily (one better than the other...), constant improvements to existing frameworks, yearly new features in ECMAScript..

I'm always eager to discover the latest updates, apps, technologies..!
