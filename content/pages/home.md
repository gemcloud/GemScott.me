hero_title: Why Netlify CMS?
hero_description: Netlify CMS is an open-source Git-based content management system. It is based on client-side JavaScript and handles content updates directly in Git. Because all content is just stored in your Git repository, you don’t need to have anything hosted on a server. It’s completely free and a great fit to combine with Next.js to build landing pages or blogs that are manageable through a nice UI.
