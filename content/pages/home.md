hero_title: Why Netlify CMS? Modified on admin
hero_description: >-
  Netlify CMS is an open-source Git-based content management system. It is based
  on client-side JavaScript and handles content updates directly in Git. Because
  all content is just stored in your Git repository, you don’t need to have
  anything hosted on a server. It’s completely free and a great fit to combine
  with Next.js to build landing pages or blogs that are manageable through a
  nice UI.
